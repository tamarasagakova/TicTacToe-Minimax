# Tic Tac Toe

### Summary:
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player board game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns placing their respective symbols, 'X' and 'O', on the grid. The objective is to form a straight line of three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before the opponent does. If the entire grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.


The AI's implementation using the minimax algorithm adds an element of challenge, making it a fun and entertaining experience for players of all ages.

### Algorithm Used:
The game employs a combination of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the optimal moves for the AI (robot) player. The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games to maximize the AI's winning chances while minimizing the player's chances. It recursively explores all possible moves and assigns scores to each based on the outcome of the game. The AI then selects the move with the highest score, while the player tries to minimize the AI's score.
